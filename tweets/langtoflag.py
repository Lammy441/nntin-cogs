    """Language codes (ISO 639-1) and country codes (ISO 3166) are built a bit differently.
    This class turns language codes into a country flag. It however has to make some assumptions.
    Such as english speakers (ISO 639-1 -> en) are from the US (ISO 3166 -> us).
    However if it is specified e.g. en-gb such generalization is not made.
    Vietnam has a VI as language code while their country code is VN.
