# nntin-cogs
I do not offer cog support.  
This is me playing with Red-DiscordBot after a long hiatus.

Cogs are untested and unfinished.

## cogs
remindme: based on [26-cogs](https://github.com/Twentysix26/26-Cogs/) with slight modification on the syntax for easier usage.  
tweets: based on [discord-twitter-bot](https://github.com/NNTin/discord-twitter-bot)  
pc: privatechannel [preview](https://i.imgur.com/CyIApEZ.gifv)  
crossbar: a crossbar client  
icu: functionality inspired by [napstr/icu](https://github.com/napstr/icu), optimized it further to make it work more universally
